# Setup Entries

A **setup entry** performs a system change that config files alone cannot: enabling a
systemd unit, registering a shell completion, installing a git hook. It pairs a `check`
command (does this already hold?) with a `run` command (make it hold).

Setup entries run during `tidydots restore`, in the order they appear under `entries`.

## Example

The `vicinae` launcher ships a systemd user unit. Installing the package and symlinking
the config is not enough — the unit must also be enabled:

```yaml
  - package:
      managers:
        yay: vicinae-bin
    name: vicinae
    entries:
      - targets:
          linux: ~/.config/vicinae
        name: config
        backup: ./Linux/vicinae
        files: [settings.json]

      - name: enable-service
        when: '{{ eq .Hostname "omarchbook" }}'
        check:
          linux: systemctl --user is-enabled --quiet vicinae.service
        run:
          linux: systemctl --user enable --now vicinae.service
```

On restore, tidydots runs the check. If the unit is already enabled the check exits 0 and
nothing happens. If it is not, the run command executes, and the check runs a second time
to confirm the change actually took effect.

The optional entry-level `when` expression uses the same syntax as an
[application condition](applications.md#when-expressions). Both the application and
entry conditions must evaluate to `true` for this setup entry to apply. A false
result or template error skips the entry **before** tidydots evaluates the OS maps,
runs `check` (including a dry-run check), or runs `run`; it is also hidden from the
TUI manage view. Explicitly targeting an excluded setup entry returns a conditions
mismatch error.

## How it works

```
1. no `run` command for this OS  -> skip
2. `check` exits 0               -> skip, report "Set up"
3. --dry-run                     -> report what would run; never runs it
4. execute `run`                 -> a non-zero exit is an error
5. re-run `check`                -> still failing is an error
```

Step 5 catches a script that exits 0 without doing its job.

## Editing in the TUI

The TUI application form can create and edit setup entries. On the sub-entry form, enable
**Setup entry** to replace config fields with these command pairs:

- `Check (linux)` and `Run (linux)`
- `Check (windows)` and `Run (windows)`
- `Sudo`
- `When` — optional condition for this individual setup entry

Each configured OS must have both a check and a run command, and at least one OS must be
configured. The form refuses to save a partial pair or an entry with no configured OS.
Setup entries cannot have `backup` or `targets`; choose the config-entry mode to edit those
fields instead. Saving writes the resulting `check` and `run` maps to `tidydots.yaml`.

For the **When** field, `enter` or `e` opens the hostname chooser when saved hostname
choices are available in `tidydots.yaml`. Select hosts with `space` or `tab`, then
confirm to generate an expression; choose **Type expression** to enter a Go-template
condition manually.

From the main TUI list, `r` runs the selected setup entry (or selected application's setup
entries), while `x` includes entries whose check currently fails in the action filter. Setup
checks also run during TUI state detection, so keep them read-only and fast.

## Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `name` | string | Required. Identifies the step in output and in the TUI. |
| `when` | string | Optional. Go-template condition for this setup entry. |
| `check` | map: OS → command | Required. Exit 0 means "already set up". |
| `run` | map: OS → command | Required. Runs only when `check` fails. |
| `sudo` | bool | Optional. Runs `run` with elevated privileges. `check` never uses sudo. |

A sub-entry is either a **config entry** (it has a `backup`) or a **setup entry** (it has
a `run`). It cannot be both, and a setup entry cannot declare `targets`.

Every OS listed under `run` must also be listed under `check`, and vice versa. This is
enforced at load time.

## The OS map is the platform gate

An absent OS key means the step does not apply there. The entry above has no `windows:`
key, so it is skipped entirely on Windows. No `when:` clause is needed for this — though
the application's own `when:` still gates the whole group. Use an entry-level `when:`
when the step is restricted by context other than its OS map, such as hostname.

## Commands

Commands run through `sh -c` on Unix and `powershell -Command` on Windows, with the
configurations repo root as the working directory. That means multi-line commands and
repo-relative script paths both work:

```yaml
      - name: install-hooks
        check:
          linux: test -x /etc/pacman.d/hooks/pkg-backup-aur.hook
        run:
          linux: sh ./Linux/pacman/install-hooks.sh
        sudo: true
```

## The check contract

**Check commands must be side-effect free and fast.**

They are executed:

- on every `tidydots restore`,
- during `--dry-run` (this is how dry-run can truthfully report whether the setup *would*
  run),
- and on every TUI state-detection pass.

`systemctl --user is-enabled --quiet vicinae.service` satisfies both requirements. A check
that mutates state, prompts, or takes seconds to return will make tidydots feel broken.

tidydots cannot enforce this — it is a contract you accept when you write a setup entry.

## No state is stored

There is no database and no marker file. The check *is* the state. If you later disable
the vicinae unit by hand, the next restore notices and re-enables it.

This is deliberate: a "we already ran this once" record would go stale the moment its
effect was undone, and the step would never repair itself.

## Security

Setup commands are arbitrary shell commands from your configuration file. Only use
configurations you trust.
