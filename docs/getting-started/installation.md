# Installation

## Prerequisites

tidydots is written in Go. You need **Go 1.25 or later** installed on your system.

To check your Go version:

```bash
go version
```

If you do not have Go installed, follow the [official Go installation guide](https://go.dev/doc/install) for your platform.

## Install with `go install`

The simplest way to install tidydots is with `go install`:

```bash
go install github.com/AntoineGS/tidydots/cmd/tidydots@latest
```

This downloads, compiles, and installs the `tidydots` binary into your `$GOPATH/bin` directory (usually `~/go/bin`).

!!! tip
    Make sure `$GOPATH/bin` is in your `PATH`. You can add this to your shell profile:

    ```bash
    export PATH="$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin"
    ```

## Build from source

If you prefer to build from source, or want to contribute to the project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AntoineGS/tidydots.git
cd tidydots
go build ./cmd/tidydots
```

This produces a `tidydots` binary in the current directory. You can move it to a directory on your `PATH`:

```bash
# Linux / macOS
sudo mv tidydots /usr/local/bin/

# Or keep it local
mv tidydots ~/go/bin/
```

## Verify the installation

Run the help command to confirm tidydots is installed and accessible:

```bash
tidydots --help
```

You should see output similar to:

Run 'tidydots init <path>' to set up the app configuration.
Run without arguments to start the interactive TUI.
